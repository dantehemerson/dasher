dasher
=======

A simple bash-like prompt for [ZIM](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw) with some personal customizations.

### Install

Add this line to your `~/.zimrc`:

```
zmdule dantehemerson/dasher
```

### Features:

* Simple prompt. No user or machine info. I don't need that, it's always me.
* Virtual Environment support.
* Git branch and status.

This theme is based on Spriithy's [`basher` prompt](https://gitlab.com/Spriithy/basher) and Eric Nielsen's [`gitster` prompt](https://github.com/zimfw/gitster).
